                This part is crucial that you do not step away, if you want the roux to be correct, this is what you have to do.

                already, thaw and peel the shrimp.
            </li></p>
            <p><li>Once the time is up, add the Shrimp and Okra to the pot and continue simmering for 10 minutes or until the Shrimp is pink and
