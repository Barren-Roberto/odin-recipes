        <strong>Instructions</strong>
        <ol>
            <p><li>
                To prepare the Dough: Combine butter, light brown sugar, white sugar, vanilla 
                extract, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and nutmeg in the bowl of a stand 
                mixer fitted with a padded attachement.
            </li></p>
            <p><li>
                Mix on low to moisten, then increase speed to medium and beat until soft, fluffy, and pale, about 8 minutes;
                halfway through, pause to scrape bowl and beater with a flexible spatula. With mixer running, add Eggs
                one at a time, letting each incorporate fully before adding the next. Reduce speed to low, then add flour
                all at once. When flour is incorporated, add chocolate chips and nuts and keep mixing until dough is homogenous.
            </li></p>
            <p><li>
                Divide dough into 8 equal portions(about 6 ounces each) and round each into a smooth ball.
                Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 12 hours before baking; if well protected from air, 
                the dough can be kept in the fridge up to 1 week.
            </li></p>
            <p><li>
                To bake: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Line an aluminum half-sheet pan 
                with parchment paper. When the oven comes to temperature, arrange up to 4 portions of cold dough on prepared pan,
                leaving ample space between them to account for spread. If you like, sprinkle additional salt to taste.
            </li></p>
            <p><li>
                Bake until cookies are puffed and lightly brown, about 22 minutes, or to an internal temperature of 175-185 degrees fahrenheit.
                The ideal temperature will vary from person to person; future rounds can be baked more or less to achieve desired consistency.
            </li></p>
            <p><li>
                Cool cookies directly on baking sheet until no warmer than 100 degrees fahrenheit before serving. 
                Enjoy warm, or within 12 hours!
